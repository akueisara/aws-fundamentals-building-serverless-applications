## AWS Fundamentals: Building Serverless Applications

These exercises are from the Courser course https://www.coursera.org/learn/aws-fundamentals-building-serverless-applications 

The course is taught in JavaScript. I editted the instructions for the exercises and added the Python code instead. 

If you like, you can follow this repository's instructions to do the exercises using **Python**.
